## 🔧 What Needs Forms/Templates

The **models and views are 100% complete**. You need to add HTML templates for:

1. **Patient Forms**
   - `templates/patients/patient_register.html` - Registration form
   - `templates/patients/patient_list.html` - List view
   - `templates/patients/patient_detail.html` - Detail view

2. **Appointment Forms**
   - `templates/appointments/appointment_create.html`
   - `templates/appointments/queue_display.html` ← Priority (WebSocket)
   - `templates/appointments/display_monitor.html` ← For big screen

3. **Other CRUD Forms**
   - Lab order forms
   - Pharmacy sale forms
   - Prescription forms
   
   *Tip: Use `django-crispy-forms` with Bootstrap 5 for quick form rendering*

---

## 🎨 UI Customization

The base template (`templates/base.html`) includes:
- Responsive sidebar navigation
- Role-based menu items
- Top navbar with user info
- Bootstrap 5 styling
- Chart.js integration ready

**To customize:**
1. Edit `templates/base.html` for layout
2. Add custom CSS in `static/css/`
3. Add JavaScript in `static/js/`

---

## 📱 Mobile App Integration

REST API endpoints are configured at `/api/`:
- Patient CRUD
- Appointment management
- Lab orders
- Pharmacy sales
- Authentication

**To implement:**
1. Create ViewSets in each app's `api.py`
2. Register in `diagcenter/api_urls.py`
3. Use Token Authentication for mobile apps

---

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ Django's built-in authentication  
✅ CSRF protection  
✅ Role-based permissions  
✅ `@login_required` decorators  
✅ Password hashing  
✅ Session management

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production

### High Priority
1. ✅ Create form templates (use Django forms + crispy-forms)
2. ✅ Add print stylesheets for prescriptions/reports
3. ✅ Test WebSocket queue system with Redis
4. ✅ Set up nginx + gunicorn for deployment

### Medium Priority
5. ⚠️ Add form validation
6. ⚠️ Implement pagination for lists
7. ⚠️ Add search/filter functionality
8. ⚠️ Generate PDF reports

### Optional Enhancements
9. ⭕ SMS notifications (Twilio)
10. ⭕ Email prescriptions
11. ⭕ Payment gateway integration
12. ⭕ Backup/restore functionality

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Templates**: Most views have placeholder templates - forms need to be built
2. **Redis Requirement**: WebSocket features require Redis running
3. **Voice Announcements**: pyttsx3 works on Linux but may need espeak installed
4. **Static Files**: Run `collectstatic` before production deployment

---

## 📦 Dependencies

All listed in `requirements.txt`:
- Django 5.2.7
- Django REST Framework
- Django Channels (WebSocket)
- Daphne (ASGI server)
- Redis client
