## Next Steps for Full Functionality:

### 1. Update View Functions
The dashboard views in `accounts/views.py` need to be updated to provide context data:

```python
# Example for doctor_dashboard:
def doctor_dashboard(request):
    waiting_count = Appointment.objects.filter(
        doctor=request.user, 
        status='waiting',
        appointment_date=timezone.now().date()
    ).count()
    
    completed_count = Appointment.objects.filter(
        doctor=request.user,
        status='completed',
        appointment_date=timezone.now().date()
    ).count()
    
    appointments = Appointment.objects.filter(
        doctor=request.user,
        appointment_date=timezone.now().date()
    ).order_by('appointment_time')
    
    context = {
        'waiting_count': waiting_count,
        'completed_count': completed_count,
        'appointments': appointments
    }
    return render(request, 'accounts/doctor_dashboard.html', context)
```

### 2. Test Login Flow
With CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS now configured for GitHub Codespaces:

**Test Credentials:**
- Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
- Doctor: `doctor1` / `doctor123`
- Receptionist: `reception1` / `reception123`

### 3. Create AJAX Endpoints
Add these URL patterns for real-time updates:
- `/lab/orders/<id>/update-status/` - Lab status updates
- `/survey/orders/<id>/update-status/` - Canteen order updates
- `/appointments/<id>/call-patient/` - Call patient notification

### 4. WebSocket Integration
Connect dashboards to WebSocket consumers for:
- Real-time queue updates on doctor dashboard
- Live appointment notifications
- Instant status changes

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Login with each role (admin, doctor, receptionist, lab, pharmacy, canteen)
- [ ] Verify correct dashboard loads based on user role
- [ ] Check responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Test empty states (no data scenarios)
- [ ] Verify all links and buttons
- [ ] Test AJAX status update functions
- [ ] Check CSRF token functionality
- [ ] Verify Bootstrap styling consistency

## Known Issues:

1. **View Functions Need Data**: Currently views return empty context - need to query database
2. **AJAX Endpoints Missing**: Status update endpoints need to be created
3. **WebSocket Not Connected**: Real-time updates need WebSocket integration
4. **Sample Data Needed**: Run `create_sample_data.py` to populate database
